# bb-hidden-classes

This plugin lets you toggle the visibility of items with the classes of .hidden and .sr-only when you're inside the Beaver Builder editor.

Once you install the plugin, it will add an option to the main BB menu dropdown in the editor header. There is also a keyboard shortcut to toggle as well of <kbd>cmd (ctrl)</kbd> + <kbd>=</kbd>
