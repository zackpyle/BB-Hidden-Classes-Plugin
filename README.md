# BB Hidden Classes

This wordpress plugin is an addon to Beaver Builder. It lets you toggle the visibility of items with the classes of .hidden and .sr-only when you're inside the Beaver Builder editor.

Once you install the plugin, it will add a button to the main BB menu dropdown in the editor header to toggle. There is also a keyboard shortcut to toggle as well of <kbd>cmd (ctrl)</kbd> + <kbd>=</kbd>

When toggled to visible, it will outline the hidden item and let you know what class it has.
